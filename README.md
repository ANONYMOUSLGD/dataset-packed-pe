# Dataset of packed PE files

This is a fork of the dataset at [https://github.com/chesvectain/PackingData](https://github.com/chesvectain/PackingData) with some samples sanitized (e.g. UPX-packed samples in the ´Notpacked´ folder or samples with a same hash from the packer and `Notpacked` folders).
